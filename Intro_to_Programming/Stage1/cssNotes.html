        <h3>About CSS</h3>
        <p>
          CSS is used to keep the <em>design</em> away from the <em>document</em>.
          It also allows you to follow the coder credo, <b>"never repeat yourself"</b>.
          By integrating the use of structures such as div tags and CSS you can easily control formatting
          across a variety of elements with minimal lines of code/repetition.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if you name your div class "section", you can format all div class "section"
          with "".section {"css code here"}"".  This is called a class selector.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h4>Class Selectors</h4>
          Class selectors are your friend. They are probably the most useful and versatile selectors
          out there. In part because they are well supported in all browsers. In part because you
          can add multiple classes (just separated by a space) on HTML elements. In part because
          there are JavaScript things you can do specifically for manipulating classes.
