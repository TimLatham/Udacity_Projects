          <h3>About CSS</h3>
          <p>
            CSS is used to keep the <em>design</em> away from the <em>document</em>.
            It also allows you to follow the coder credo, <b>"never repeat yourself"</b>.
            By integrating the use of structures such as div tags and CSS you can easily control formatting
            across a variety of elements with minimal lines of code/repetition.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, if you name your div class "section", you can format all div class "section"
            with "".section {"css code here"}"".  This is called a class selector.
          </p>
          <h4>Class Selectors</h4>
          <p>
            Class selectors are your friend. They are probably the most useful and versatile selectors
            out there. In part because they are well supported in all browsers. In part because you
            can add multiple classes (just separated by a space) on HTML elements. In part because
            there are JavaScript things you can do specifically for manipulating classes.

          <h3>Boxes</h3>
          Flexbox is helpful, see link at beginning for more on how this works.
          <h4>Box Sizing</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components.</li>
            <li>Because there are so many components to each box, it can often be hard to get the size of a box just right.</li>
            <li>There are two techniques you can use to help deal with sizing issues.</li>
              <ol>
                <li>Set sizes in terms of percentages rather than pixels.</li>
                <li>Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element.</li>
              </ol>
            <li>Different browsers work slightly differently. Sometimes this causes different browsers to display the same code differently.</li>
          </ol>
          <h4>Box Positioning</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Divs are block elements (as opposed to inline), so by default they take up the entire width of a page.</li>
            <li>Adding the rule display: flex; to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.</li>
          </ol>
