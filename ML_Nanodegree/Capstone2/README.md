# Lending Club Data Analysis

This project uses the [Lending Club dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data).  Download the files from there and from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/TimLatham/Udacity_Projects/tree/master/ML_Nanodegree/Capstone2) to the same directory.  

The algorithms and techniques for this model were implemented using the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) (iPython) notebook program provided via an installation of [Anaconda Navigator](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) on Python 2.7.  

Libraries utilized in the loanAnalysis.ipynb file included [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), [time](https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html), [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

To implement, use the following steps:
1. Import the lending club dataset and my GitHub repository as linked above.  
2. Unzip both files to a shared/common directory.
3. Run the loanFileCleanup.py program to generate the loan_data.csv file for use in the loanAnalysis.ipynb Jupyter notebook.
4. Open and run the loanAnalysis.ipynb file in Jupyter.
